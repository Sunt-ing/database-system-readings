# Introduction
This is a curated reading list about database systems. Book digests can be found in README, while paper digests are located in the issue list.
In the paper digest, I will try to answer the following questions: 
- What problem does the paper solve? Is it important? 
- How does it solve the problem? 
- How does their approach differ from previous ones? Are they adequately discussed in the reading? 
- How does this work relate to other research? 
- What could be improved?
