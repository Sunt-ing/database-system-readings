# Introduction
This is a curated reading list about database systems, including digests of books/papers/blogs.

Book list can be found in README, while paper and blog digests are located in the issue list. 

In the issue list, a closed issue means that the report about it was finished, while an open one means that it's to-be-appeared or on-the-flying. 

For each paper digest, I will try to answer the following questions: 
- What problem does the paper solve? Is it important? 
- How does it solve the problem? 
- How does their approaches differ from previous ones? Are they adequately discussed in the reading? 
- What could be improved? 
- Anything interesting about it?
